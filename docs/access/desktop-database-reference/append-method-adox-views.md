# Append Method (ADOX Views)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013


Creates a new [View](view-object-adox.md) object and appends it to the [Views](views-collection-adox.md) collection.

## Syntax

*Views*.Append*Name*, *Command*

## Parameters

  - *Name*

  - A **String** value that specifies the name of the view to create.

  - *Command*

  - An ADO [Command](command-object-ado.md) object that represents the view to create.

## Remarks

Creates a new view in the data source with the name and attributes specified in the **Command** object.

If the command text that the user specifies represents a procedure rather than a view, the behavior is dependent upon the provider. **Append** will fail if the provider does not support persisting commands.


> [!NOTE]
> When using the OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Jet, the **Views** collection **Append** method will allow you to specify a **Procedure** rather than a **View** in the *Command* parameter. The **Procedure** will be added to the data source and will be added to the **Views** collection. After the **Append**, if the **Procedures** and **Views** collections are refreshed, the **Procedure** will no longer be in the **Views** collection and will appear in the **Procedures** collection.
