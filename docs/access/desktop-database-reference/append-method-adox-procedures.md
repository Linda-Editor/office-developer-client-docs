# Append Method (ADOX Procedures)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013


Adds a new [Procedure](procedure-object-adox.md) object to the [Procedures](procedures-collection-adox.md) collection.

## Syntax

*Procedures*.Append*Name*, *Command*

## Parameters

  - *Name*

  - A **String** value that specifies the name of the procedure to create and append.

  - *Command*

  - An ADO [Command](command-object-ado.md) object that represents the procedure to create and append.

## Remarks

Creates a new procedure in the data source with the name and attributes specified in the **Command** object.

If the command text that the user specifies represents a view rather than a procedure, the behavior is dependent upon the provider being used. **Append** will fail if the provider does not support persisting commands.


> [!NOTE]
> When using the OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Jet, the **Procedures** collection **Append** method will allow you to specify a **View** rather than a **Procedure** in the *Command* parameter. The **View** will be added to the data source and will be added to the **Procedures** collection. After the **Append**, if the **Procedures** and **Views** collections are refreshed, the **View** will no longer be in the **Procedures** collection and will appear in the **Views** collection.
