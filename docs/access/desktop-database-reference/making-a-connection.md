# Making a Connection

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

To connect to a data source, you must specify a *connection string*, the parameters of which might differ for each provider and data source. For more information, see [Creating the Connection String](creating-the-connection-string.md).

ADO most commonly opens a connection by using the **Connection** object **Open** method. The syntax for the **Open** method is shown here:

```vb
Dim connection as New ADODB.Connection 
connection.Open ConnectionString, UserID, Password, OpenOptions
```

Alternatively, you can invoke a shortcut technique, **Recordset.Open**, to open an implicit connection and issue a command over that connection in one operation. Do this by passing in a valid connection string as the *ActiveConnection* argument to the **Open** method. Here is the syntax for each method in Visual Basic:

```vb
Dim recordset as ADODB.Recordset 
Set recordset = New ADODB.Recordset 
recordset.Open Source, ActiveConnection, CursorType, LockType, Options
```

> [!NOTE]
> When should you use a **Connection** object vs. the **Recordset.Open** shortcut? Use the **Connection** object if you plan to open more than one **Recordset**, or when executing multiple commands. A connection is still created by ADO implicitly when you use the **Recordset.Open** shortcut.
